### Project: Npc_Track

Npc_Track is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Enhancements Implemented

- New Features
  - Attendance
    - What it does:
      - Allows TA to mark or unmark a students attendance for a particular tutorial session.
      - This feature helps the TA to manage their students attendance record.
  - Participation
    - What it does:
      - Allows TA to input participation points to students for a specified tutorial session.
      - Allows TA to check a students participation record.
      - This feature addresses the need for a more detailed and granular view of students' participation and
        engagement in tutorials. It complements the existing attendance management system,
        making it a more comprehensive tool for educators and administrators.
  - Confirm Clear Command
    - What it does:
      - When users want to clear the list, they will receive a warning message, asking them to enter 'yes' if they
      really want to clear.
      - This feature addresses the need for a secondary protection, in case the user doesn't want to clear.
- Test Coverage:
  - Testing has been done for all the features I implemented.
- Code Refactoring:
  - Did code refactoring so that command classes can be simpler.
