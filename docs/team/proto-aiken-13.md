### Project: npc_track

npc_track is a desktop app for managing student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project:

### Code Contributions

	- Refactored the attendance class to support different attendance statuses (Present, Absent, VR, and Unmarked attendances)

	- Fix `unmarkGroupAtd` error throwing if the markGroupAtd format format was incorrect/missing parameters.
	- Helped to add test cases to the markAttendance using partition testing principles and made sure that all inputted statuses were valid, building on the already existing test cases made by fellow teammates Choon Yan and Si Yuan.
