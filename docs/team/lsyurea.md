### Project: npc_track

npc_track is a desktop app for managing student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
